Try to avoid global variables. Global variables can cause side-effects, which make the software system hard to understand and maintain. Instead of declaring `API_KEY` globally, consider handling it in a function or a dedicated constants/constants class.\n   \n2. You could define a `TaskCreator` class that would create tasks, and a `ZoneCreator` class that would create zones. Then, create a `Scheduler` class that would handle the scheduling of these tasks. This follows the `Single Responsibility Principle`.\n\n3. You could consider creating domain specific classes for each functionalities and hiding the concrete details in different classes. For example, for tasks related operations, you may create a `TaskRepository` class; for scheduling related operations use the `Scheduler` class mentioned above; for API calls to Todoist create a `TodoistService` class.\n\n4. Consider moving the classes into separate files/modules. This would make it easier to structure the application and would improve code maintainability as well.\n\n5. Decouple the `Task`, `Day`, `Zone`, and `Planner` classes from the Flask routes. Try keeping your business logic (`Task`, `Day`, `Zone`, `Planner` classes) away from the frameworks/routes you are using. This way you can easily swap out or upgrade your frameworks without modifying the business logic. \n\n6. Avoid hardcoding the weekdays and zones in the `Planner` class constructor. You should make the class flexible by taking these parameters as inputs. This way they can be easily changed based on requirements.\n\nHere's an part of the overview of the restructured code\n\n```\n- my_application\n    - __init__.py\n    - models\n        - __init__.py\n        - task.py (this will define the Task class)\n        - day.py (this will define the Day class)\n        - zone.py (this will define the Zone class)\n    - services\n        - __init__.py\n        - todoistservice.py (this will define the TodoistService class)\n        - taskcreator.py (this will define the TaskCreator class)\n        - zonecreator.py (this will define the ZoneCreator class)\n    - planner.py (this will define the Planner class)\n    - routes.py (this will handle routes)\n```\nThis is not the final code but it's a high level view of separating the existing monolithic file into different modules. Each module can also be unit-tested independently, providing information about which module might be causing a potential issue.\n\n5. After you finish separating classes into different modules, next is to follow SOLID principles, making sure each class has single responsibility, they are open for extension but closed for modification, and they work abstractions and not actual implementations. Try encapsulate all the specifics and complex computation inside a function or class to maintain a clean and tidy structure.\n\n6. Design your application handling possible change in the business rules in the future. Modularize your code making new features easy to add without damaging existing ones. For example, if you'll have more metadata on `Task` class in the future, extract the metadata construction in a separate builder class.\n\nKeep your modules simple, easy to understand with distinct responsibility and make sure they talk each other through abstractions. This will make your application more maintainable and easily understandable. Especially, Team members could work on separate components easily with this type of code design. \n\nRework, review, and revise your code regularly. Always look for ways to clarify your code, to make it more readable and maintainable."},{"role":"user","content":"1) Please provide classes and keep SOILD principles\n2) Please use strict Python typing\n3) Please follow open close principle\n4) Classes should be easy to test with Pytest"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Looking at the code, it's evident that it violates several SOLID principles:\n\n1. Single Responsibility Principle: A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.\nMore than one responsibility is given to the class Planner as it is responsible for scheduling and generating a data structure for frontend consumption.\n2. Open-Closed Principle: Entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.\nWe see this violated in the Planner class as well, which would need modification if you want to add a new scheduling strategy.\n3. Liskov Substitution Principle: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.\nNot applicable to the current architecture as no child classes extend a parent.\n4. Interface Segregation Principle: Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.\nNot applicable to the current architecture given no clear client functions in the classes.\n5. Dependency Inversion Principle: High-level modules should not depend upon low-level modules. Both should depend upon abstractions.\nThis is seen in the Planner class which has hard dependencies on the Zone and Day classes.\n\nHere is a redesign:\n```python\n# Consider splitting these classes into different python files/modules based on functionality.\n\nfrom abc import ABC, abstractmethod\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing import List\n\n\nclass IScheduleStrategy(ABC):\n    \"\"\" Creating schedule strategy Interface\"\"\"\n    @abstractmethod\n    def schedule(self, tasks: List['Task'], days: List['Day']):\n        raise NotImplementedError\n\n\n@dataclass\nclass Task:\n  title: str\n  label: str\n  duration: int \n  scheduled_date: dt.datetime = None  # Set datetime to have strict typing\n  scheduled_start: dt.datetime = None  # Set datetime to have strict typing\n\n\nclass Zone:\n   # attributes...\n   ...\n    \nclass Day:\n   # attributes...\n   ...\n\n\nclass DefaultScheduleStrategy(IScheduleStrategy):\n    \"\"\"\n    The default strategy for scheduling.

By testing one component at a time, error diagnosis becomes easier and code reliability increases."},{"role":"user","content":"Which class would write first to be able to create Unit tests as well?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"To follow the Test-driven development (TDD) approach, I would suggest you start with the simplest and most independent element, which in this case, would be the `Task` class. Here's a sequence of steps you can follow:\n\n1. Write tests for `Task` class in a separate test file (yields rapid feedback as it is relatively independent and simpler).\n\n```python\n# task_test.py\n\nimport pytest\nfrom task import Task\nimport datetime\n\ndef test_initialization():\n    title = \"a new task\"\n    label = \"ForMyself\"\n    duration = 30\n    task = Task(title, label, duration)\n    assert task.title == title\n    assert task.label == label\n    assert task.duration == duration\n    assert task.scheduled_date is None\n    assert task.scheduled_start is None\n```\n\n2. Write the `Task` class itself.\n\n```python\n# task.py\n\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\n\n@dataclass\nclass Task:\n    title: str\n    label: str\n    duration: int\n    scheduled_date: datetime.datetime = None  # Whatever appropriate value\n    scheduled_start: datetime.datetime = None  # Whatever appropriate value \n```\n\n3. Run pytest from command line to make sure `Task` class passes test.\n\n```bash\n# command line\npytest task_test.py\n```\n\n4. Repeat this process for `Zone` class and `Day` class, since they have some level of dependence on `Task` and each other.\n\n5. After `Task`, `Zone`, `Day` classes are tested and complete, write tests for the `Planner` class. \n\n6. Implement `Planner` class itself keeping in mind to follow SOLID principles.\n\nLastly, integrate all these classes together in a meaningful way while running pytest frequently to ensure that new code doesn't break old one. Repeat the process of writing tests -> write code -> test -> refactor for other classes as well.
